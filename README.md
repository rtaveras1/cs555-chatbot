# cs555-chatbot

This chatbot identifies keywords from user input to give back definitions of the terminology found. If a keyword is not found, then it asks for one keyword to store in an arraylist so that when the developer goes back to update it, it will have a list of words it could add to make the bot smarter overtime.
If I had more time, I would have implemented a feature that allows for the bot to take input back to back instead of having to run it again after each input.
